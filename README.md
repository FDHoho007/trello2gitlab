# Trello2GitLab

This python script helps you to migrate your Trello issue board into a GitLab project issue board.
It uses an export of your Trello board to then generate a valid GitLab export file,
which in turn can be used to import as a GitLab project containing your issues.

This project is inspired by https://gitlab.com/tristanpct/trello2gitlab/ which
* did not work anymore when I tried to use it in 2023
* has to be compiled
* needs API Access and therefore some tokens aquired by hand
